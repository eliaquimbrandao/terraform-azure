## Overview

Welcome to the **Terraform Examples for Azure** repository! This collection provides **simple and practical Terraform configurations** for managing and automating Azure infrastructure. Our goal is to make it easy for anyone to get started with Terraform on Azure, whether you're deploying basic resources, setting up pods, or exploring specific Azure services.

By leveraging **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with Terraform, these examples ensure **consistency**, **repeatability**, and **scalability** across your Azure deployments. We hope these configurations help you quickly utilize Terraform for efficient and reliable deployments.

## Technologies

The following tools and technologies are used in this project:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) - for defining, provisioning, and managing Azure infrastructure as code.
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/) - to facilitate authentication and access management within Azure.

## Collaboration & Contribution

We believe in the power of community! This project is a collaborative effort, and **your ideas and contributions are highly encouraged**. Whether you're a Terraform expert or new to IaC, your input helps make these configurations more versatile and useful for everyone.

- **Found an issue?** Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/eliaquimbrandao/terraform-azure/issues).
- **Have a feature request or improvement?** Let's discuss it!
- **Want to contribute?** You're welcome to submit a pull request.

Let's work together to simplify Azure resource management and create reusable, maintainable infrastructure code with Terraform.

## Goals

Our goal is to support the community in unlocking the full potential of Azure through Terraform. We aim to:

- Provide clear and concise examples for common Azure scenarios.
- Make Terraform configurations accessible and easy to understand.
- Encourage learning and sharing of best practices within the community.
