# azure-terraform-scripts

## Overview

This repository provides Terraform configurations for managing and automating Azure infrastructure. It’s tailored for scenarios where Azure resources require an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach, enabling consistency, repeatability, and scalability across deployments.

## Technologies

The following tools and technologies are used in this project:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) - for defining, provisioning, and managing Azure infrastructure as code.
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/) - to facilitate authentication and access management within Azure.

## Collaboration & Contribution

This project is a collaborative effort, constantly evolving to address new challenges and accommodate a wide range of Azure infrastructure needs. **Your ideas and contributions are highly encouraged!** Whether you’re a Terraform expert or new to IaC, your input helps make these configurations more versatile and impactful.

Feel free to submit issues, suggest features, or contribute directly through pull requests. Let’s work together to simplify Azure resource management and create reusable, maintainable infrastructure code.

## Goals

- Provide Terraform configurations for deploying and managing various Azure resources.
- Foster an open community to innovate and develop new solutions for automating Azure infrastructure tasks.
- Continuously enhance and update Terraform scripts to align with the latest Azure features and best practices.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local environment to start working with the Terraform configurations.
2. **Configure Azure CLI Authentication**: Ensure you’re authenticated with Azure CLI by running `az login`.
3. **Terraform Setup**: Install Terraform and initialize the project with `terraform init`.
4. **Deploy Resources**: Use `terraform apply` to deploy the resources as per your defined configuration.
