## Overview

Welcome to the **Terraform Examples for Azure** repository! This collection provides **simple and practical Terraform configurations** for managing and automating Azure infrastructure. Our goal is to make it easy for anyone to get started with Terraform on Azure, whether you're deploying basic resources, setting up pods, or exploring specific Azure services.

By leveraging **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with Terraform, these examples ensure **consistency**, **repeatability**, and **scalability** across your Azure deployments. We hope these configurations help you quickly utilize Terraform for efficient and reliable deployments.

## Technologies Used

- **[Terraform Core](https://www.terraform.io/)**: Define and provision infrastructure as code.
- **[Azure Provider (`azurerm`)](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs)**: Interact with Azure services using Terraform.
- **[Azure APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/?view=Azure)**: RESTful APIs for communication between Terraform and Azure.

- **Authentication Methods**:
  - **[Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/)**: Facilitate authentication and access management within Azure.
  - **[Service Principals](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals)**: Secure identities for authenticating with Azure.
  - **[Managed Identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview)**: Authenticate without managing credentials.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Git**: If you haven‚Äôt already, [install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your machine by following the instructions for your operating system.
   
2. **Configure Git**: Set up your Git identity by configuring your username and email:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```
   
3. **Clone the Repository**: Once Git is installed and identity configured, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eliaquimbrandao/terraform-azure.git
   ```

4. **Install Terraform**: If you haven't already, [install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) on your machine.

5. **Authenticate with Azure**:

   - Log in using [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest#az-login):

     ```bash
     az login
     ```

   - Or set up a [Service Principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest#az-ad-sp-create-for-rbac):

     ```bash
     az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "terraform-sp" --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/<subscription-id>"
     ```

4. **Explore and Experiment**: Now that you‚Äôre all set up, and ready to dive into the Terraform code. Enjoy exploring and building! üéâ

## Examples

Each example resides in its own directory with specific instructions:

- **Networking**: [terraform-azure/networking](terraform-azure/networking) ‚è≥ Pending  
- **Virtual Machine**: [terraform-azure/virtual-machine](terraform-azure/virtual-machine) ‚è≥ Pending  
- **Storage Sync Services (Azure File Sync)**: [terraform-azure/storage-sync](https://github.com/eliaquimbrandao/terraform-azure/tree/main/storage-sync) ‚úÖ Completed
- **Storage Account**: [terraform-azure/storage-account](terraform-azure/storage-account) ‚è≥ Pending  

*(More examples as they become available.)*

## Collaboration & Contribution

We believe in the power of community! This project is a collaborative effort, and **your ideas and contributions are highly encouraged**. Whether you're a Terraform expert or new to IaC, your input helps make these configurations more versatile and useful for everyone.
